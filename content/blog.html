                            Questions we are all asking ourselves: Do I need a personal page? Will potential employer look to see one? 
                            Should I build it from scratch, or should I get a template? How interactive it should be? Should I put my personal information out 
                            for the entire world to see? There are some fascinating threads on quora, hackernoon and reddit on this topic. Most developers or engineers have a personal website, and they should. 
                            Most of Dev's sites are portfolios or have a portfolio page. 
                            If your web-site has the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>It describes skills and interests</li>
                                <li>It links to professional social profiles</li>
                                <li>It showcases the work you are proud of</li>
                                <li>It stays relevant and updated</li>
                            </ul>
                            Your site can serve you well by creating a candy wrap around you as a valuable asset.

                            Some people however face challenges with the design part of creating  the web-site as UI is what is supposed to communicate all of the info, but they can still be good engineers.

                        Building your first app can be scary and frustrating. But that is ok, it is supposed to be. 
                        If you are new to engineering, start small and stay organized while building.
                        The following steps could be a good start:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Come up with a goal or a mission - simply what it is that your app is going to do for the people</li>
                            <li>Scetch a wireframe on a piece of paper</li>
                            <li>Find design insiration</li>
                            <li>Define your tech stack</li>
                            <li>Create wireframe</li>
                            <li>Start building... </li>
                        </ul>
